SYNTHETIC RETAIL OPS NOTES (training notes for assistants)
Purpose: Practice data for a small RAG demo. Generalized retail + pharmacy ops thinking.
Data policy: Fictional and generic. No internal systems, no customer data, no proprietary documents.

PROFITABILITY (WHAT ACTUALLY MOVES THE NEEDLE)

If you’re trying to protect profit, your two monsters are labor and shrink. Everything else is smaller.

The goal isn’t “cut hours.” It’s “put hours where demand is” and stop paying for dead time.

LABOR (COVERAGE, NOT VIBES)

Build the schedule off workload: traffic, pickup patterns, and Rx volume. Don’t copy last week because it’s easy.

Protect the real peaks (midday rush, after-work drive time, pickup surges). Trim overlap when the store is quiet.

Cross-train so people can float (checkout, photo, pickup). Idle time is expensive.

Watch overtime, last-minute shift swaps, and “just stay late” culture. That stuff sneaks in and wrecks the week.

SHRINK (DEATH BY A THOUSAND PAPER CUTS)

High-risk categories are usually small, high-dollar, and easy to pocket (cosmetics, OTC meds, diabetes supplies, infant formula, small accessories).

Voids/refunds are a goldmine. Review them routinely and look for patterns by person and time window.

Receiving matters. Messy backroom leads to bad counts, phantom inventory, and shrink later.

Zone and face like you mean it. Missing product shows up in the aisle before it shows up in reports.

PROMOS AND PRICING (EXECUTION > INTENTION)

A promo display that doesn’t match the weekly plan is basically a donation to chaos.

Promo without correct signage/pricing kills lift. Customers don’t “figure it out.”

Track sell-through. If something isn’t moving, don’t let it rot—relocate, mark down, or transfer.

Teach basket-building prompts at checkout (water, seasonal, small add-ons). It’s small, but it stacks.

OUT-OF-STOCKS (SILENT REVENUE LEAK)

Outs don’t just lose that sale—they lose the whole basket.

Run an outs scan consistently. Prioritize high-velocity, high-margin items first.

Sanity-check shelf counts versus backroom counts. If counts are wrong, every “automatic” order is wrong too.

PHARMACY VOLUME (WHAT CREATES GROWTH)

The pharmacy grows when service is predictable and the team works the right queues, not when people “try harder.”

IMMUNIZATIONS / CLINICAL SERVICES

Seasonal vaccines and clinical services increase touchpoints and bring people back into the building.

Outreach works best before peaks, not during them. Book early, then ride the wave.

Keep reminders simple and consistent (where appropriate). Overcomplicated messaging doesn’t happen.

ADHERENCE (KEEP THE SCRIPTS YOU ALREADY EARNED)

90-day, auto-refill, and sync programs help retention, but only if exceptions get worked daily.

Work the exception lists daily (late-to-fill, too-soon, refill gaps). Don’t let them age.

Assign ownership: one person, one queue, clear goal for the shift.

PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS (QUIET MULTIPLIER)

New patient flow is influenced by nearby clinics, urgent care, and prescribers.

Fast, accurate fills plus low rework builds trust and repeat referrals.

Offer practical solutions for high-touch meds (packaging options, delivery where available).

SERVICE (THE STUFF CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY FEEL)

Wait time, accuracy, and friendliness decide retention.

Consistent staffing and “we always have it handled” beats heroics.

WEEKEND STAFFING (WHERE STORES GET HURT)

Weekend staffing should follow demand, not posted hours.

Use historical Saturday/Sunday volume and pickup patterns to schedule coverage.

If mornings spike, staff earlier with overlap. If evenings spike, keep coverage later to finish strong.

Don’t leave one person doing drop-off, pickup, and production at peak. That creates errors and angry customers.

Rotate weekend load across the team to reduce burnout.

OPERATING RHYTHM (PROTECT THE WEEK)

Daily

Zone/face, outs scan, clean up pickup area, review exceptions, quick void/refund glance.

Weekly

Labor vs plan review, high-loss review, promo compliance walk, queue health check.

Monthly

Clinical performance review, outreach log, inventory accuracy trends.

WHAT TO WATCH (SIMPLE SCOREBOARD)

Labor % to sales (front) and hours per Rx (pharmacy).

Shrink trend in high-risk categories.

Clinical counts versus a peer benchmark.

Volume by day-of-week so weekends aren’t a surprise every week.
