Walgreens – Store Ops Notes (for training/assistants)

1. Front-end profitability (EBITDA drivers)
- EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) at the store level is most sensitive to controllable expenses.
- Primary levers:
  a. Labor:
     - Schedule to workload, not to habit; use forecasted sales/Rx volume to set hours.
     - Protect peak hours (10a–2p, drive-time, script pickup) and trim low-value coverage.
     - Cross-train photo/checkout to reduce idle time.
     - Watch OT, shift pick-ups, and unapproved extends.
  b. Shrink:
     - Lock high-loss categories (beauty, OTC, diabetes, infant formula, sexual health).
     - Daily void/refund review; investigate patterns by TM and time of day.
     - Keep receiving clean — backroom errors become shrink.
     - Front-face/zone daily to spot missing/high-risk items.
  c. Promo effectiveness:
     - Endcaps and power aisles must match the weekly ad.
     - Use signage and correct pricing — promo without signing = missed lift.
     - Track promo sell-through; transfer, markdown, or flex if not moving.
     - Coach cashiers to suggestive-sell basket builders (water, candy, seasonal).
- Secondary levers:
  - Out-of-stocks kill margin because guests trade down or leave. Run outs nightly.
  - Front store standards (clean, faced, lit) increase impulse purchases.
  - Photo, immunizations, and pickup all increase traffic, which helps front-store sales.

2. Pharmacy volume and growth
- Pharmacy volume is primarily driven by:
  a. Immunizations:
     - Flu, COVID, RSV, and pneumonia (when appropriate) increase patient touchpoints.
     - Proactive outreach (text/call) before season peaks drives appointments.
     - Running store announcements every 20–30 minutes raises awareness.
  b. Adherence:
     - 90-day conversions, auto-refills, and sync programs improve kept scripts.
     - Late-to-fill and too-soon reports should be worked daily.
     - Techs should be assigned to adherence tasks with clear goals.
  c. Provider relationships:
     - Nearby clinics/urgent care drive new patients; check in regularly.
     - Fast, accurate fill times and low rework make prescribers send more to the store.
     - Offer solutions for high-touch meds (special packaging, delivery if available).
- Service factors:
  - Wait-time, accuracy, and friendliness all affect whether a patient stays.
  - Consistent vaccine/clinical availability makes the store the “default” for the area.

3. Weekend staffing and volume alignment
- Weekend staffing should match script volume and pickup patterns, not just posted store hours.
- Use historical Saturday/Sunday Rx counts to build the schedule.
- If Saturday AM is heavy: staff earlier with a tech and pharmacist overlap.
- If Sunday PM is heavy: keep coverage later to finish fills and pickups.
- Avoid leaving 1 person to run drop-off, pickup, and production during peak — it creates errors and bad service.
- Consider rotating weekends across pharmacists/techs to prevent burnout and maintain service.

4. Operational rhythms to protect performance
- Daily: zone, outs, Rx queue clean-up, void/refund check, pickup shelf clean.
- Weekly: labor vs. plan review, shrink/high-loss review, promo compliance walk.
- Monthly: immunization performance, provider outreach log, inventory accuracy review.

5. What to watch
- Labor % to sales (front) and hours per Rx (pharmacy).
- Shrink in high-risk/OTC categories.
- Immunization counts vs. district average.
- Script volume by day-of-week to optimize weekend coverage.
